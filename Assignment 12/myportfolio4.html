			I am a student pursuing degree in Programming and Development. I am also transitioning from Chemistry to IT field. Before the transition, I worked as a Research Chemist in a pharmaceutical company for over 5 years. With technology advancing in such a fast pace and lot of scope to learn new skills, I have decided to make the career change. As a Chemist, I always excelled in troubleshooting of problems related to software of analytical instruments. My analytical mind and problem solving capabilities gave me the confidence that I can be successful in this field. I am also inspired by one of my friends who took a similar path five years ago and has a successful career now.

		    I worked as a summer intern for "Services for Independent Living,Inc.", where I was responsible to enhance their existing website. I had an incredible opportunity to work with experienced programmers in developing a website for SIL. Check out their new website at <a href=http://sil-oh.org/ target="_blank">www.sil-oh.org</a>.
